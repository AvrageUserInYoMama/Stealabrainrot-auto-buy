**Notes**

This tool does NOT access roblox and doesn't use game code to its advantage.
This tool supports multiple robloxes
The smaller your window size, the less accruate the scanner will be.
This will grab your screen to buy brainrots if roblox isnt already focused

**How it Works**

It basicly just scans roblox looking for the name of a brainrot
when it sees one it holds E for 3.5 seconds (buying it)

**CONFIG**

You are able to change:
Which brainrots it buys
How long it holds E
And the size of the scanner
